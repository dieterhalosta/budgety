# Budgety

This is an app build during a Javascript online course from Udemy.
As the name says it's a budget app to allow you to track your income and expences.
Build using only HTML, CSS and Vanila Javascript. Due to the nature of the course it's build using JS5.

Since this was build during the beginning of my journey, it's not very complex and it could be improved. Most likely I will upgrad it to React in the future.
